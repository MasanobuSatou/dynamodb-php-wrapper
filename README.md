dynamodb-php-wrapper
====================

Access AWS DynamoDB through simpler interface.

This module is simpler because:
* The results of each API are mapped to Array object automatically.
* The request exceeding the limit can be sent by dividing into small ones automatically.
* The response exceeding the limit can be fetched by requesting continuously.

If you get interested in this module, please see [the wiki](https://github.com/masayuki0812/dynamodb-php-wrapper/wiki).
